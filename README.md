**A db of 350 crowdfunding campaigns supporting candidates standing in ge2017**



#### Overview:
We’ve pulled down 350 crowdfunding campaigns supporting candidates standing in the upcoming General Election on June 8, 2017. We did this by identifying pages manually and then scraping the contents into a database. Our research focused on the crowdfunding campaigns hosted on the four main platforms for political crowdfunding: Crowdfunder, JustGiving, GoFundMe and CrowdPac.

We found that general election candidates and local party groups have collectively crowdfunded nearly £440,000 across the UK since the election was called five weeks ago. 

The Green Party are the most prolific users of crowdfunding websites, but there are also 70 Labour candidates, 52 SNP candidates, 12 Conservative candidates and 14 Liberal Democrat candidates running campaigns to replenish their election war chests. 

There are 36 candidates from other political parties, including the National Health Action Party and Sinn Fein, and 27 candidates standing as independents.

Two of the four crowdfunding platforms analysed, JustGiving and GoFundMe, have disclosed that they do not pass sufficient information to candidates to enable them to verify that donors are on the electoral register, which is required by law for donations of over £50. Those platforms only pass on name and email. Candidates require home address details to verify the donor as permissible and would need to email to obtain it.

We think there are interesting angles that relate to your patch. This reporting recipe is to give you some ideas of how to dig into the data.



#### Disclaimer:
A couple of important points if you intent to publish the data presented here.

You must give candidates and donors named a chance to respond to any comment or allegation.

It would be great if you could mention Bureau Local in the piece and link to us in any online copy. :smile:
